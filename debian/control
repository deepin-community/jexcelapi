Description: Java API to read, write and modify Excel spreadsheets
 The Java Excel API is an open source Java API which allows Java developers to
 read Excel spreadsheets and to generate Excel spreadsheets dynamically. In
 addition, it contains a mechanism which allows java applications to read in a
 spreadsheet, modify some cells and write out the new spreadsheet.
 .
 This API allows non Windows operating systems to run pure Java applications
 which can both process and deliver Excel spreadsheets. Because it is Java,
 this API may be invoked from within a servlet, thus giving access to Excel
 functionality over internet and intranet web applications.
